# Gap Analysis Report
**Project:** MCE Platform
**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Status:** **CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED**

## 1. Executive Summary
The backend infrastructure for campaigns, workflows, and messaging appears robust and implemented in Node.js/Express. However, the Frontend (Next.js) is largely a **static prototype**. Key features required for the "Functional Requirements" are **completely missing** from the user interface.

## 2. Component Audits

### 2.1 Campaigns Module
*   **Requirement:** Users can create multi-step campaigns and view real-time stats.
*   **Current State:**
    *   `campaigns/page.tsx` uses hardcoded static data (`useState` with mock array).
    *   No API calls to `GET /api/campaigns`.
    *   "Create Campaign" button is non-functional.
    *   **Gap:** **100% Missing UI.** No builder, no real list, no controls.

### 2.2 Automation/Workflow Module
*   **Requirement:** Visual builder for triggers and actions.
*   **Current State:**
    *   `automations/page.tsx` renders static HTML cards.
    *   No integration with `React Flow` (despite dependency being present in `package.json`?).
    *   No API calls to `/api/workflows`.
    *   **Gap:** **100% Missing UI.** The visual editor does not exist.

### 2.3 Messaging (Chat Window)
*   **Requirement:** Real-time chat with leads via WhatsApp.
*   **Current State:**
    *   (Pending analysis of `ChatWindow.tsx`) - *Likely partially implemented.*
    *   Backend `whatsapp.js` is fully featured.
    *   **Gap:** Need to confirm if "Send" actually calls the API.

### 2.4 Lead Management
*   **Requirement:** Import CSV and Real-time Feed.
*   **Current State:**
    *   Dashboard seems to fetch leads (`page.tsx` has a `fetch` call), so this part is **Partially Working**.
    *   **Gap:** "Import CSV" button/modal is missing from the UI.

## 3. Discrepancy Matrix

| Feature | Backend Support | Frontend UI | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lead Listing** | ✅ Ready | ✅ Partially Implemented | **Warning** (Pagination?) |
| **Lead Import** | ✅ Ready | ❌ Missing | **Gap** |
| **Chat History** | ✅ Ready | ❓ Checking | **In Progress** |
| **Send Message** | ✅ Ready | ❓ Checking | **In Progress** |
| **Create Campaign** | ✅ Ready | ❌ Mock Only | **Critical Gap** |
| **Campaign Stats** | ✅ Ready | ❌ Mock Only | **Critical Gap** |
| **Workflow Builder** | ✅ Ready | ❌ Mock Only | **Critical Gap** |
| **Analytics** | ✅ Ready | ❌ Mock Only | **Critical Gap** |

## 4. Recommendations
1.  **Priority 1:** Build the **functional** `ChatWindow` to ensure communication works.
2.  **Priority 2:** Implement the **Campaign Creation Wizard** (Form-based first, then visual).
3.  **Priority 3:** Create the **Visual Workflow Builder** using React Flow.
4.  **Priority 4:** Connect the **Analytics Dashboard** to real API endpoints.
