# Software Development Plan (SDLC)
**Project:** MCE Platform
**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Methodology:** Agile / Iterative

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the MCE Platform. We are following an iterative approach, prioritizing the closure of critical gaps identified in the analysis phase.

## 2. Phases

### Phase 1: Requirement Analysis (Completed)
**Goal:** Define what needs to be built.
*   **Activities:** Reverse-engineering existing code, defining user roles, and mapping journeys.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   [Product Requirements Document (PRD)](Product_Requirements_Document.md)
    *   [User Stories](User_Stories.md)
    *   [Functional Requirements](Functional_Requirements.md)

### Phase 2: System Design & Gap Analysis (Completed)
**Goal:** Architect the solution and identify missing pieces.
*   **Activities:** Noun-verb analysis, functional decomposition, and auditing the current codebase.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   [Gap Analysis Report](Gap_Analysis.md)
    *   [Noun-Verb Analysis](Noun_Verb_Analysis.md)
    *   [Functional Decomposition](Functional_Decomposition.md)
    *   [User Journey Map](User_Journey_Map.md)

### Phase 3: Implementation (Current Phase)
**Goal:** Build missing features and refine existing ones.
*   **Strategy:** Prioritize "Critical Gaps" found in Phase 2.
*   **Sprint 1: Core User Interface (Frontend)**
    *   Objective: Build Campaign Creation Wizard and Messaging UI.
    *   Reference: `Gap_Analysis.md` (Items 2.1, 2.3).
*   **Sprint 2: Visualization & Automation**
    *   Objective: Implement React Flow for Workflows.
    *   Reference: `Gap_Analysis.md` (Item 2.2).
*   **Sprint 3: Backend Hardening**
    *   Objective: Ensure Validation and Security.

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification
**Goal:** Ensure quality and reliability.
*   **Unit Testing:** Test individual utility functions (e.g., CSV parser).
*   **Integration Testing:** Test API endpoints with valid/invalid payloads.
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Verify flows against [User Journey Map](User_Journey_Map.md).

### Phase 5: Deployment & Maintenance
**Goal:** Launch and sustain.
*   **Deployment:** Dockerize the application for easy hosting.
*   **Monitoring:** Set up health checks for the WhatsApp Puppeteer instance.

## 3. Workflow Standard
1.  **Select Task:** Choose an item from the Task List or Gap Analysis.
2.  **Implementation Plan:** Draft a plan for the specific feature.
3.  **Code:** Implement changes.
4.  **Verify:** Run local tests.
5.  **Documentation:** Update functional docs if behavior changes.
